## Calculator for values table for 5/3/1 lifting program

I've been doing Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 program (https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/531-how-to-build-pure-strength) for a while now, I originally used it to break a plateu but it just kind of worked really well for me so I've just kept at it.
I got a bit tired of doing all the calculations so I made this little util to do it for me. 

It's just some barebones js, but it does the job.
